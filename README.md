## AWS::MWAA::Environment

This package adds **MWAA Environment** type to [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/).

Schema exists in `aws-mwaa-environment.json` file.

The RPDK will automatically generate the correct resource model from the schema whenever the project is built via Maven.
You can also do this manually with the following command: `cfn generate`.

The code uses [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/), and [you may have to install IDE integrations](https://projectlombok.org/setup/overview) to enable auto-complete for Lombok-annotated classes.
